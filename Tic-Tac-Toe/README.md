# Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax Algorithm

## Overview

Explore the world of intelligent gameplay with this Tic-Tac-Toe AI, powered by the Minimax algorithm. The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making strategy commonly employed in two-player games, aiming to find the optimal moves that minimize potential losses while maximizing wins. In the context of Tic-Tac-Toe, the AI evaluates various game states to strategically select its next move, creating a challenging and engaging experience for players.

## Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm operates by considering all possible moves in the current game state, creating a game tree that extends to a specified depth. It assigns a score to each terminal state (win, lose, or draw) and propagates these scores back up the tree. The AI player then makes decisions that lead to the path with the highest score when it is the AI's turn and the lowest score when it is the opponent's turn. This ensures that the AI makes optimal decisions in a turn-based game like Tic-Tac-Toe, providing an intelligent and competitive opponent.

Experience the thrill of playing against an AI that strategically plans its moves using the Minimax algorithm, offering an engaging and thought-provoking gaming experience.
