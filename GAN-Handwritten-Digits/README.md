# MNIST GAN: Generating Realistic Handwritten Digits

## Overview

This implementation focuses on training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate lifelike handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The GAN architecture comprises two key components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator aims to produce synthetic images resembling handwritten digits, while the discriminator's role is to differentiate between genuine dataset images and those generated by the generator.

## Dual-Framework Implementation

To highlight flexibility, we employ both PyTorch and TensorFlow, two leading deep learning frameworks. PyTorch, known for its dynamic computation graph, and TensorFlow, a widely-used framework with a static computation graph, showcase distinct approaches. This dual-framework strategy allows users to explore and compare GAN implementations in both environments.

## Workflow

1. **Dataset Loading:** Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images representing digits 0 through 9.

2. **Model Definition:**
   - *Generator:* Creates synthetic images.
   - *Discriminator:* Distinguishes between real and synthetic images.

3. **Training Loop:**
   - Iterative adversarial training for generator and discriminator improvement.
   - Dynamically observe enhancements in image generation quality.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize generated images to assess GAN performance.
   - Compare PyTorch and TensorFlow outputs for insights into framework-specific nuances.

## Benefits

- **PyTorch:**
  - Dynamic computation graph.
  - Intuitive interface suitable for research applications.

- **TensorFlow:**
  - Static computation graph.
  - Widely adopted in production settings.

This dual-framework approach provides a comprehensive understanding of GAN implementation, catering to both research-oriented and production-focused deep learning environments.
